### Charlon

My career path is to be a senior technical officer, focusing on providing operational support to the hospital and health services sites. 


### Andrew

My ideal job of Software Engineer is still very appealing as it is the type of work and role that interests me more than whether the specific and general skills required are in demand more than others. Certainly, as far as employment opportunity is concerned, focusing on those skills that are most in demand seems a wise decision. However, a job role is more than a set of skills and there are other considerations that should be taken into account.

The work environment can be a very important element when choosing a position in an organisation. This can sometimes be difficult to determine especially for those organisations that are not too well known, or that reviews cannot be sourced.

As well as the work environment, the type of work can also play a important role. The skills required across many different jobs can be similar and are in most cases transferrable.

It hasn’t changed my opinion whatsoever, if anything, it has inspired me to continue on with this choice of career path. The demand is high and it is challenging and rewarding work. Another factor is that the skillset is transferable to other areas of development. By not being restricted to one particular line of development makes perfect sense to me. The ability to travel anywhere, and work in any part of the world this is extremely appealing to me.

With the knowledge and skillsets developed, freelance work could also be an avenue of opportunity available to utilise as an additional source of income.

Although mobile application development doesn't feature highly on the top occupations ladder, the programming skillset would still avail me to other industry specific opportunities.
