**What is the state of the art of this new technology?**

A Raspberry Pi is one of the worlds smallest desktop (or portable) computers. It is about the size of a credit-card and consists of a processor, RAM (random access memory) and standard hardware ports you would associate with most computers. 
With almost everything similar to a regular computer, this means you’re able to do most things a desktop computer can do.
You can edit documents, you can watch HD video, you can play games, you can surf the internet, you can use it as an [Onion router] (https://www.raspberrypi.org/magpi/tor-router/) or you can simply use it for coding.
Generally speaking you will install Raspbian OS (a Debian based operating system, which is a flavor of Linux).
This OS is different to windows in many ways however it isn’t too difficult to navigate around and there is plenty of help out there in the Raspberry Pi community to find what you’re looking for.
The current model is a Raspberry Pi 3 model B+ which has the following specs:
* 1.4GHz 64-bit quad-core processor
* dual-band wireless LAN
*	Bluetooth 4.2/BLE
*	Faster Ethernet
*	1GB LPDDR2 SDRAM
*	Gigabit Ethernet over USB 2.0 (maximum throughput 300 Mbps)
*	Extended 40-pin GPIO header
*	Full-size HDMI
*	4 USB 2.0 ports
*	CSI camera port for connecting a Raspberry Pi camera
*	DSI display port for connecting a Raspberry Pi touchscreen display
*	4-pole stereo output and composite video port
*	Micro SD port for loading your operating system and storing data
*	5V/2.5A DC power input

The initial goal of Raspberry Pi developers was to increase the number of people applying to study computer science at Cambridge university. By putting cheap programmable computers in the hands of the right young people, a revival of the interest in computing as witnessed in the 80’s through models such as the Sinclair Spectrum and the Commodore 64 was hoped to be achieved.
The creators had no idea that adults would also be interested in the product and subsequently sold over 10 million units within a four year period.

There are many Raspberry projects available through quick internet searches for you to follow.
Some such projects are:
* Setting up your Pi as a VPN
* Using your Pi as a portable gaming console (mainly for retro games)
* Setting up a digital clock by using led lighting.
* You can set up Xbox controllers and PlayStation controllers on the Pi
* You can set up RaspbiCast, which is a form of Chromecast.

These things plus many more are things that the Pi is capable of doing now with the technology we have available. The list is growing everyday as people invent new ideas of what they can use their Pi for.
As new developments emerge, the possibilities of new project uses for the Pi increase.
The future of Raspberry Pi could be that it is used in small to medium businesses as a thin client and connect to the cloud. The potential savings of replacement traditional desktop computers would be enormous as the Pi is generally around the $50 price tag.
Some companies are already re-developing the Pi and creating actual thin clients for the market. With the current trend in virtualization this is being taken into consideration and the Pi will be used as virtual desktops and applications.

**What is the likely impact?**

The likely impact of this new development which will see the Raspberry Pi being used in virtualization would see many more new startups coming in to play. 
With the current price and the ability to virtualize and utilize cloud services the cost of initial hardware setup has dramatically reduced.
As more and more businesses look to save money, the way forward for them could be by utilizing the Pi for everyday use. 
All the Pi would be doing is basically connecting to their existing cloud service and dependent on the application, the processing power of the Pi would be enough to get them through. 
They could also use one single Pi as a virtual host and potentially save even further by have two or more users accessing virtual machines from the host Pi.
I think this will create more jobs for business as the continual shift toward cloud based services and the lessening of traditional server rooms based onsite means the IT budget will shrink substantially.
This will allow more room in the budget for more staff to join and help grow the business.
Whether that be in sales or customer service, who knows? but it would be a potential and significant shift in the way IT is used in future business.
The downside to this might be in the sales arena of the bigger manufacturing companies that produce desktop computers for business use.
I would expect to see either a pushback from these companies to retain their clients or they would adopt the technology and  submit their own products into the marketplace.
Businesses would no longer need to supply laptops for staff to work from home as the Pi is extremely portable and can be taken anywhere, plugged in anywhere and used from wherever the user wants.

**How will this affect you?**

As a business manager I can see the potential for switching over to these current trends and technologies and the benefits that would result.
What would be different for me is that I wouldn’t have to supply every staff member with either laptops or expensive smartphones as they could take the Raspberry pi home or even out on jobs.
As the Pi has the ability to connect wirelessly and a touch screen can be connected, the Pi can be used as a mini tablet or phone.
Any friend or family member that doesn’t have the budget to be able to upgrade or even access the internet would be able to do so now.
The potential to connect with all friends and family through this cheap PC alternative is very real and very exciting.
Third world countries would benefit greatly and allow startups to blossom without having to find capital for equipment investment.
This would help to boost their national economy and create employment and eventually help to bring their people to a decent standard of living.
With access to modern technologies and I would think an abundance of untapped new ideas, all sorts of new developments could emerge.
As always, there is a downside to everything, with the availability of such cheap computing power, scammers would now have access to a tool that has not previously been an option. 
This could potentially lead to an influx in a problem that we already have.
I think that it would see newer security techniques being developed to help prevent this type of activity been used and in the process create more jobs in the IT security sector.
In summary, all in all I believe that this little device has a lot more to bring to the table than it currently does.
If the explosion of smart phones due to their portability and processing power is anything to go by, then keep a close eye out for this little fella in the future.
I may not be personally affected by future developments with the Pi but I’m certain that there will be millions of people who will be advantaged by it’s capabilities and power.
