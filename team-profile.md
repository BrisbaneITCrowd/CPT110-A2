Much like some of the others in the group, Andrew has been working in technology related roles for various organisations for many years.

### Paul Harmon

Paul has been immersed in technology for many years, having started using computers during his school years. Even after taking a break from technology soon after leaving school, Paul has since been drawn back to the technology industry.

### Lee May

Lee is originally from New Zealand and has a passion for motorcycles, golf, and  an artistic interest in sketching and airbrushing.

Lee's interest in IT originated from performing upgrades, repairs and assisting friends and family with their computing problems. This has expanded from an unplanned exposure to programming through a work colleague.

Since then, the ability to create software to provide solutions for business outcomes, a well as personal interest, has led to Lee seeking further knowledge in software development, turning this interest into career aspirations.

### Team Profile Summary and Analysis

The results from the three personality tests completed by each member of the team indicates that while there are a number of similarities, there are also comparative differences. The common personality traits that each person has, shows that there is a solid foundation of a task focused, analytical and collaborative work ethic that will prove very useful for this assignment as well as any future assignments that this same group works on together.

While there are a number of introverted personalities, the contrasting extraverted tendencies of others in the group will provide a good balance of leadership and group dynamic.

Everyone shows an openness and a level of agreeableness that will encourage a positive, supportive and level of inclusion for all team members. Overall, and based on the test results, the team should achieve a good working environment, during both face to face meetings, as well as remote, virtual meetings, that will focus on productive, task oriented outcomes.

Maintaining this personality momentum will most likely be the only challenge as the course progresses and the work loads increase. However, after the initial face to face meeting held last Saturday, there are very positive indications that each team member will be able to contribute thoroughly while at the same time providing a supportive environment for any team member that requires assistance.

## Ideal Jobs

Darren: Senior Technical Developer - programming, management, leadership, team leader, project management

Charlon: Senior Technology Officer - management, project management, systems administration, systems architect

Andrew: Software Engineer - programming, problem solving

Paul: Cyper Security Practice Lead - cryptography, systems adminsitration, security management, problem solving

Lee: Mobile Application Developer - programming, problem solving

### Ideal Jobs Summary and Analysis

There are two very distinct career plans evident in the chosen ideal jobs by members of the team.

The first career type is very clearly along the lines of technical team leadership with elements of project management. These job roles are positions where the incumbent is responsible for providing direction of operational activities in an ICT environment that requires many years of experience in systems management, and development.

The second career type is focused on software development of different types of systems. These roles require experience in a number of programming languages, an understanding of software development methodologies and modern software development environments. In addition, the ability to use software to develop solutions to real world problems is also one of the requirements for these roles.

While these two career paths follow different specifics, they are both similar in some respects. They require a number of years of experience in similar roles, and the environments in which they operate are almost identical. The environment is based around creating, managing and delivering solutions that requires knowledge of technology systems, the ability to develop software to interact with systems and the leadership to guide other individuals to achieving the outcomes required.

So far as the dynamic of the group is concerned, with relation to the ideal jobs, the overall career direction of all team members is very similar. Each person desires a role that creates software based solutions. This desire fits in nicely with the content of this course as well as the other courses likely to be undertaken in the coming study periods.
