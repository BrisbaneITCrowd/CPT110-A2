 ## Clouds, Services, Servers

As what computers do get more complicated, the tasks they perform grow more diverse and the results are needed to be accessed from more and more locations. The needs of the average user have gotten beyond the said user's ability to afford or maintain. 

To combat this in the new millennium the “cloud” has moved from a vague buzzword in corporate boardrooms to something that is pretty much the foundation of Information services today.

I think to properly discuss, I need to define the three terms individually:

# Cloud,

There is a joke amongst IT people, “There is no cloud, it is just someone else’s computer” and to be honest this is true, The cloud is someone else’s computer sitting in someone elses network connected to the Internet, however most people including System administrators, do not need to know what sort of hardware, network or operating system the infrastructure is running on, all you need to worry about is the service you require is up accessible and stable. 

To simplify network diagrams technicians and engineers would use a cloud as the symbol of what is on the other side of the edge of what they can control and do not need to document, or support and this interpretation were carried over into the acquisition of services. 

The service is the part we need to be concerned about, what the hardware it sits on or even where it sits inconsequential. Hence we refer to the cloud, rather than use a detailed description of what we do not need to know about.

# Services,

Simply put a service is the job that the computer has been set to do, or simply put the service the computer provides to the end user’s computer. Services vary from network storage to Email, from Databases to Web servers, Terminal emulators to gaming and thousands of other jobs computers can do. 

Services can have their own dedicated server or share a server with other services depending on the requirements of the service, emails, printing and fileshares can be a single server for a small company where a large corporation is likely to have emails shared across numerous servers in numerous locations.

# Servers,

Servers are the “other person’s computer” that provide services and physically make up the cloud. This is quite a simplification and very vague, A laptop under someone’s bed with a file share application such as bit torrent running is technically a server in the cloud as is a Dell EMC or HP Blade system cluster providing multiple servers via HyperV or VMM and taking up an entire building floor. Any computer providing one or more service is technically a server. 

The range and scope of what makes up a server are why we refer to a cloud rather than once again use a detailed description of what we do not need to be concerned about. If the laptop under the bed or the old PC on the shelf is providing the service in a stable and secure way, why purchase hundreds of thousands of dollars of hardware you really do not need.

# Client,

Whilst not one of the three terms I think the client is a term that needs to be included, the client is the PC, smartphone, tablet or anything else in the [Internet Of Things (IoT).](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Internet_of_things) The reason I think the client is an important term is the client is the part of the cloud that the user sees and physically interacts with. Even the most powerful server is just a very expensive box of useless electronics without at least one client.

So what we have is a varied collection of computers we refer to as Servers, doing a multiple of different jobs we refer to as Services connected in a cacophony of Switches, Routers, Firewalls and other networking components all bundled together and referred to as a The Cloud. Clear? Great can you explain it to me?

Sometimes I think the more you try to explain cloud the more confusing it can get, which makes sense as Cloud is the definition we use to simplify complex systems, once you attempt to explain simple, she packs her bags and leaves whilst complex spreads to take over the whole couch.

The cloud is also quite the area of debate in the IT industry some people love it and some hate it. Having an ethereal entity on the web is great the physical maintenance, real estate etc are still not your problem, your concentration can be on more critical areas of IT, all good right? Are you sure, is it secure? if you do not know where it is or even what it is, how can you be sure?

What are the persons hosting your section clouds level of competence, could they accidently wipe your data, what is their WAN connection like, how many other people are sharing it?

The list of issues and concerns that the system administrator hands off to the cloud provider are varied, A really good Cloud provider or host will advertise as having a rating of 5,9s meaning 99.999% uptime which is great but as a Sysadmin, who is the boss going to be screaming at when the service he needs is not working?
